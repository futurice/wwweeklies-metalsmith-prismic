      <h1>How to talk customers into creating Open Source and what you need to know about IPR</h1>

      <h2>Why should we care about open sourcing anything?</h2>
      <p>Basically, you are paying for the contributions of the developer(s) involved, but you get more with the same money.</p>
      <p>And, you will be able to benefit from the new features and bug fixes that land on the open source project from the other users.</p>
      <h2>Open source software is eating the world</h2>
      <p>The forerunners of digital services are creating more and more open source. Software development is not commodity, but the basic building blocks of making great services are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cloud platforms such as Heroku and Amazon Web Services</li>
        <li>Open data APIs</li>
        <li>Open source components</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is very essential that we are not re-inventing the wheel but instead building on <em>and</em> contributing to the open source projects.</p>
      <p>Examples of some forerunners are</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/opensource">Microsoft</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.walmartlabs.com/">Walmart</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tech.zalando.com/">Zalando</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Giving back is good PR</h2>
      <p>Developers want to build things that they can use themselves</p>
      <p>By embracing the open source community you are able to attract good developers</p>
      <p>Participating in open source community is the best platform to learn development, teamwork, communication and it all builds up for your CV</p>
      <p>You <em>can</em> and you <em>should </em>use the PR. We <a href="http://futurice.com/blog/year-2015-in-company-sponsored-open-source">do it</a> as well.</p>
      <h2>OK, sounds good, but what does it mean in terms of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)?</h2>
      <p>As always, everything we develop for you, remains your intellectual property.</p>
      <p>By agreeing to publish open source you are giving other people the permission to use the project within the license terms. We favour a permissive license such as <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> or <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a>. They enable you and others to modify the code for commercial purposes without requiring them to contribute back.</p>
      <h2>So how are you going to make all this happen?</h2>
      <p>Basically you just need to decide what is the visibility you wish to have:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You retain all of your IPR and your company name is mentioned in the copyright clause together with Futurice and others – you get the PR as well</li>
        <li>If you wish, you can transfer your IPR to us and we can mention you in the contributors – you still get the PR</li>
        <li>If you wish to not be mentioned, you can transfer the IPR to us and we don't have to mention you in any way – then you really are not getting the PR out of this</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>This is very interesting but I'm still very confused</h2>
      <p>Please do come talk to us, our Social responsibility lead <a href="http://futurice.com/people/teemu-turunen">Teemu Turunen</a> can help you understand it all and consult you in the open source jungle.</p>
